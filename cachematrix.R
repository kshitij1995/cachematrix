## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv_x <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv_x <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse<- function(inverse) inv_x <<-inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv_x
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if (!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv
}
